# J124-FINAL-PROJECT: Data Analysis and Visualization of the Effects of the Distribution of Black Teachers on Black Students 
## by Emmanuelle Mphuthi 
### Story Summary 

My story aims to highligth the effects of having a small Black teacher population on Black students in the state of California. Particularly, this projet found that in schools with a small Black teacher population, Black students encounter a higher risk of getting punished, suspended and/or expelled from school, as opposed to schools with a larger Black teacher population. I focused on two Californian school districts in Alameda County and Orange County: Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) and Newport-Mesa Unfiied School District (N-MUSD). The data analysis found that there is a strong correlation between the improvement of the overall academic performance of Black students all levels of education, and a strong presence of Black teaching personnel at their school. It is hard to define what a "strong" presence means, but I believe the minimum ratio of Black students per Black teacher should be at least 10:1. This would prevent Black students from falling into the school-to-prison pipeline, which disproportionately targets students of color, and particular Black male students. Additionally, this story aims to contest the assumption that a school with a low Black student populaton does not require an equal or greater Black teacher population. I am to demonstrate that these students, who are already minorities within their peer group, need even more representation in the people in charge of their education. Thus, this story aims to propose that more Black teachers be a) formed in the areas where they are scarce so they may assist Black students and imporve their future prospects and b)transferred to these areas in order to fill the vacancy. Having teachers that are the same race as students significantly improves morale, retention, graduation/achievement rates and attendance. 

I chose Alameda County and the Oakland Unified School District for a few reasons. Firstly, Black teachers make up the fourth largest demographic in the county's total teacher population (1,047 out of 12,320 teachers betweeen 2018-2019). Despite representing only 8.50% of the total teacher population in the state, it is vital to note that Alameda County is the county with the most Black teachers in California, as per my analysis.  Secondly, the OUSD is the district with the msot significant Black teacher population from 2018-2019. Black students in the OUSD represent 23.50% of the total student population between 2018-2019, the second largest demographic after Hispanic or Latino children. 
I chose Orange County and the Newport-Mesa Unfiied School District for the simple reason that they both have very small population of Black students and teachers. I wanted to pick areas with small enough populations to reap useful results, without vying for populations that are so small that the results wouldn't fully portray how urgent the matter is.
