# J124-FINAL-PROJECT: Data Analysis and Visualization of the Effects of the Distribution of Black Teachers on Black Students 
## by Emmanuelle Mphuthi 
### Story Summary 

My story aims to highligth the effects of having a small Black teacher population on Black students in the state of California. Particularly, this projet found that in schools with a small Black teacher population, Black students encounter a higher risk of getting punished, suspended and/or expelled from school, as opposed to schools with a larger Black teacher population. I focused on two Californian school districts in Alameda County and Orange County: Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) and Folsom-Cordova Unified (F-CUSD). The data analysis found that there is a strong correlation between the improvement of the overall academic performance of Black students all levels of education, and a strong presence of Black teaching personnel at their school. It is hard to define what a "strong" presence means, but I believe the minimum ratio of Black students per Black teacher should be at least 10:1. This would prevent more Black students from falling into the school-to-prison pipeline, which disproportionately targets students of color, and particular Black male students. Additionally, this story aims to contest the assumption that a school with a low Black student populaton does not require an equal or greater Black teacher population. I am to demonstrate that these students, who are already minorities within their peer group, need even more representation in the people in charge of their education. Thus, this story aims to propose that more Black teachers be a) formed in the areas where they are scarce so they may assist Black students and imporve their future prospects and b)transferred to these areas in order to fill the vacancy. Having teachers that are the same race as students significantly improves morale, retention, graduation/achievement rates and attendance. 

I chose Alameda County and the Oakland Unified School District for a few reasons. Firstly, Black teachers make up the fourth largest demographic in the county's total teacher population (1,047 out of 12,320 teachers betweeen 2018-2019). Despite representing only 8.50% of the total teacher population in the state, it is vital to note that Alameda County is the county with the most Black teachers in California, as per my analysis.  Secondly, the OUSD is the district with the msot significant Black teacher population from 2018-2019. Black students in the OUSD represent 23.50% of the total student population between 2018-2019, the second largest demographic after Hispanic or Latino children. 
I chose Sacramento County because it had more or less the same teacher and teacher population as Alameda County (both over 12,000 teachers and over 200,000 students from 2018-2019). I chose the Folsom-Cordova Unfiied School District for the simple reason that it had the lowest amount of Black teachers in the entire county (_____ teachers out of ____________). The Black student population is also quite small (_____students out of ___________).

All data was sourced from the California Department of Education (CDE). 

#### Potential Interview Contacts:
1. Tony Thurmond, the Superintendent of Public Instruction

   - Reason: As he Superintendent of Public Instruction in California, Tony Thurmond is responsible for enforcing educational law, reforming or improving education programs at all levels, reforming or improving child care programs,and deciding the measures of education regulation across the state. He would be a useful source, as he might have information that is not disclosed on the CA Department of Education website. Since his inauguration in 2019, Thurmond has put in place the Black Student Achievement Taskforce to "call out the effects that systemic and institutional racism have had on Black students in California" and "to increase funding to lowest performing students, ban suspensions and expulsions in preschools, and secure funding for suspensions and chronic absenteeism programming", according to the CDE. It would be extremely valuable to gain access to the findings of this taskforce. 
  
2. Nancy William McGee, Director of the Student Achievement and Support Division
   - E-mail: N/A
   - Contact Number: 916-319-0926
   - Reason: As the Director of this division, McGee works with local educational agencies, administrators, teachers, students, families and educational stakeholders to "ensure state and federal policies and legislation are aligned, supported, and implemented in a manner that provides each of Californiaâ€™s students with meaningful access to a fair, equitable, high-quality, and well-rounded education", according to the CDE. McGee would be a useful source as he specializes on student achievement, meaning he has expertise on the regulation and programs that have been implemented to address racial discrepancies on test scores. I could not find this information on the CDE's official website, so hearing from him would be helpful. He also works directly with families according to his division's bio, meaning he might have a unique take on the issues discussed in thsi project.
