# J124-FINAL-PROJECT: Data Analysis and Visualization of the Effects of the Distribution of Black Teachers on Black Students 
## by Emmanuelle Mphuthi 
### Story Summary 

My story aims to highligth the effects of having a small Black teacher population on Black students in the state of California. Particularly, this projet found that in schools with a small Black teacher population, Black students encounter a higher risk of getting punished, suspended and/or expelled from school, as opposed to schools with a larger Black teacher population. I focused on two Californian school districts in Alameda County and Sacramento County: Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) and Folsom-Cordova Unified (F-CUSD). The data analysis found that there is a strong correlation between the improvement of the overall academic performance of Black students all levels of education, and a strong presence of Black teaching personnel at their school. It is hard to define what a "strong" presence means, but I believe the minimum ratio of Black students per Black teacher should be 10:1. This would prevent more Black students from falling into the school-to-prison pipeline, which disproportionately targets students of color, and particular Black male students. Additionally, this story aims to contest the assumption that a school with a low Black student populaton does not require an equal or greater Black teacher population. I am to demonstrate that these students, who are already minorities within their peer group, need even more representation in the people in charge of their education. Thus, this story aims to propose that more Black teachers be a) formed in the areas where they are scarce so they may assist Black students and imporve their future prospects and b)transferred to these areas in order to fill the vacancy. Having teachers that are the same race as students significantly improves morale, retention, graduation/achievement rates and attendance. 

I chose Alameda County and the Oakland Unified School District for a few reasons. Firstly, Black teachers make up the fourth largest demographic in the county's total teacher population (1,047 out of 12,320 teachers betweeen 2018-2019). Despite representing only 8.50% of the total teacher population in the state, it is vital to note that Alameda County is the county with the most Black teachers in California, as per my analysis.  Secondly, the OUSD is the district with the msot significant Black teacher population from 2018-2019. Black students in the OUSD represent 23.50% of the total student population between 2018-2019, the second largest demographic after Hispanic or Latino children. 
I chose Sacramento County because it had more or less the same teacher and teacher population as Alameda County (both over 12,000 teachers and over 200,000 students from 2018-2019). I chose the Folsom-Cordova Unfiied School District for the simple reason that it had the lowest amount of Black teachers in the entire county (14 teachers out oF 1030). The Black student population is also quite small (1,068 Black students out of 20,605).

All data was sourced from the California Department of Education (CDE). 

#### Potential Interview Contacts:
1. Tony Thurmond, the Superintendent of Public Instruction
   - E-mail: Tony@TonyThurmond.com
   - Contact Number: 916-319-0800 (Executive Office) 
   - Reason: As he Superintendent of Public Instruction in California, Tony Thurmond is responsible for enforcing educational law, reforming or improving education programs at all levels, reforming or improving child care programs,and deciding the measures of education regulation across the state. He would be a useful source, as he might have information that is not disclosed on the CA Department of Education website. Since his inauguration in 2019, Thurmond has put in place the Black Student Achievement Taskforce to "call out the effects that systemic and institutional racism have had on Black students in California" and "to increase funding to lowest performing students, ban suspensions and expulsions in preschools, and secure funding for suspensions and chronic absenteeism programming", according to the CDE. It would be extremely valuable to gain access to the findings of this taskforce. 
  
2. Nancy William McGee, Director of the Student Achievement and Support Division
   - E-mail: N/A
   - Contact Number: 916-319-0926
   - Reason: As the Director of this division, McGee works with local educational agencies, administrators, teachers, students, families and educational stakeholders to "ensure state and federal policies and legislation are aligned, supported, and implemented in a manner that provides each of California’s students with meaningful access to a fair, equitable, high-quality, and well-rounded education", according to the CDE. McGee would be a useful source as he specializes on student achievement, meaning he has expertise on the regulation and programs that have been implemented to address racial discrepancies on test scores. I could not find this information on the CDE's official website, so hearing from him would be helpful. He also works directly with families according to his division's bio, meaning he might have a unique take on the issues discussed in this project. 

#### Additional Resources:
1. [The National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2020/2020103/index.asp#:~:text=In%20the%202017–18%20school,were%20Black%20and%20non%2DHispanic.)
   - The dataset on the linked website provides a unique perspective on the issues discussed in this project. For instance, the first finding is that "teachers of a given race/ethnicity were more often found in schools where their race/ethnicity matched a majority of the student body". This is useful because it sort answers one of the questions I ask in my Data Analysis and touches ont he overarching theme of this project. More importantly, it argues that "in schools where the majority of students are not White, the majority of teachers tended to be White". This is literally the essence of this project.
  
2. [The Black Teacher Initiative](https://blackteachercollaborative.org/stats/#:~:text=Georgia%20is%20in%20the%20top,in%20the%20country%2C%20behind%20Texas.)
   - This dataset would be a very vital additional resource, as it is led by Black teachers and was specifically made to highlight to discrepancies of the racial makeup of both student and teacher populations across the United States. The BTI also has interactive data visualization in the form of graphs and maps that the user can filter as needed. If I were to use this resource, I would filter out all US regions besides "West" and specifically look at the "Where are the Black students in the US?" map, the "Where are the Black teachers?" map and more importantly, the "Teacher Student" scatterplot, which answers some of the main questions of this project such as what is the Black-teacher-to-Black-Student-ratio in California. The scatterplot shows that for every Black teacher in California, there are 28.3 students. Finally, this data fills in the gaps in the data fromt he CDE in terms of reading proficiency by race for example, though that data is limited as well. 


### Data Analysis Process 

This section of the project outlines the questions I asked myself while going through the data in the Sourcing section. 

The data did not require much cleaning in Google Sheets, as data could be easily filtered at will on the CDE database. 

#### 1. What is the total number of black teachers in California from 2018-19? Then, compare to other demographics (ie White, Hispanic etc.)

First, I searched for teacher numbers by race in the CDE databse and found the following dataset: "Certified Staff by Race/Ethnicity Alameda County 2018-19". I filtered out all types of school administration/staff from the "Certified Staff" except for "Teachers". Then I filtered the year to 2018-2019, which was the most recently available timeframe. The races/ethnicities are the following: Hispanic, White (not Hispanic), African American (not Hispanic), American Indian/Alaskan Native (not Hispanic), Asian (not Hispanic), Pacific Islander (not Hispanic), Filipino (not Hispanic), Two Races or More (not Hispanic) and No Response. 

Then, I downloaded the data county by county and compiled this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wVNvsiat7hItWwOruKtMefD4igkixYkXFAHGS9HAKqM/edit?usp=sharing)

At this stage, I only had one sheet with the total number of teachers in California by county from 2018-2019. In order to figure out the total of each racial category, I created pivot tables to sort each county by a specific race to calculate the total number of teachers of X race in California. Here is an example of the Total African American (not Hispanic) pivot table I made:

<img width="361" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-10 at 4 48 37 AM" src="https://github.com/ManuMphuthi/J124-FINAL-PROJECT/assets/140004593/75d83215-16b6-4a0a-a019-d7bdcec48fd6">

Once I finished the pivot tables, I added all the totals to the original "Total Teachers by County by Race 2018-2019). **In total: 308,340 teachers in California from 2018-19, of which 12,156 are Black (African American).** By comparison, the top 3 largest demographics were White teachers at 180,697, Hispanic teachers at roughly 63,031 and Asian teachers at 17,651. Thus, there are roughly 14x more White teachers than Black teachers, 5x more Hispanic teachers than Black teachers and 1.5x more Asian teachers than Black teachers in California from 2018-2019.

<img width="1201" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-10 at 4 52 51 AM" src="https://github.com/ManuMphuthi/J124-FINAL-PROJECT/assets/140004593/6dc052bb-b494-43fc-ae53-9fcaa5240891">

#### 2. What percentage does the Black teacher population represent in the total teacher population of Alameda County from 2018-19? What about Sacramento? Compare to top 3 demographics.

I created a new sheet (still in the same doc) titled "Demographic Percentages". Then, I used the "Total teachers by County" sheet to calculate the percentage of each demographic in Alameda county using the following formula (and changed the values as I went down the list of races/ethnicities): **=(B2*100)/K2**. For Sacramento County, I used the same formula except it turned out like this: **=(B35*100)/K35)** (and changed the values as I went down the list of races/ethnicities)

<img width="1204" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-10 at 5 08 26 AM" src="https://github.com/ManuMphuthi/J124-FINAL-PROJECT/assets/140004593/fdc928c5-284e-4db7-b12d-09b4095e453e">

**Here, we see that African American teachers constitute 8.50% of the teacher population in Alameda County and 4.15% of the teacher population in Sacramento County from 2018-19.** 

The top 3 demographics are: White (not Hispanic), Hispanic and Asian (not Hispanic). Comparatively:
- Alameda County: White (61.13%), Hispanic (11.34%), Asian (10.77%)
- Sacramento County: White (71.75%), Hispanic (10.35%), Asian (6.80%)

#### 3. What is the total number of black teachers in OUSD and F-CUSD? Compare to top 3 demographics. 

For Oakland Unified, I returned to the CA Department of Education Teacher database that I used earlier to figure out the total amount of teachers by county from 2018-19. Then I click on the "Report" dropdown list and choose "Staff Count by County by Ethnicity (with district data0". Here, I can see every school district in Oakland Unified. I download the file and import the data onto a new sheet in the google Sheets doc where I put all of the data pertaining to teachers. 

I used this formula to calculate the sums of each racial category (and changed the values as I went down the list of races/ethnicities): **=SUM(C2:C123)

<img width="1293" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-10 at 5 53 00 AM" src="https://github.com/ManuMphuthi/J124-FINAL-PROJECT/assets/140004593/869050e2-f7bf-489c-99a8-f380e54b0664">

I did the same thing for Folsom-Cordova Unified using this formula (changing the values as I went down the list of races/ethnicities): **SUM=(C2:C34)**

<img width="1247" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-10 at 6 00 06 AM" src="https://github.com/ManuMphuthi/J124-FINAL-PROJECT/assets/140004593/48a943a5-0db8-43ff-b3db-eb39017dd9d4">

**There are 649 Black teachers in OUSD and 14 in F-CUSD.**

The top 3 demographics are: White (not Hispanic), Hispanic and Asian (not Hispanic). Comparatively:
- Oakland Unified: White (1496 teachers), Hispanic (451 teachers), Asia (301 teachers) 
- Folsom-Cordova Unified: White (898 teachers), Hispanic (63 teachers), Asia (31 teachers) 

Thus:
- OUSD: there are roughly 2.3x more White teachers than Black teachers. OUSD is the distrcit in our project where African American teachers were the second largest population after White teachers.
- F-CUSD: there are roughly 64x more White teachers than Black teachers, 4.5x more Hispanic teachers than Black teachers and 2.2x more Asian teachers than Black teachers. 

#### 4. What is the total number students OUSD and F-CUSD? What percentage do they represent?

I got my data from this CDE [database](https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/) and specifically used these datasets: [1) OUSD](https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/dqcensus/EnrEthGrd.aspx?cds=0161259&agglevel=District&year=2018-19&ro=y) and [2) F-CUSD](https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/dqcensus/EnrEthGrd.aspx?cds=3467330&agglevel=District&year=2018-19&ro=y) 

I wrote the data manually into a new doc called "OUSD and FCUSD Student Data", where for each district, I sorted the data by race/ethnicity. Then I used this formula to add the values to give a total number of students in OUSD and F-CUSD: **=SUM(A2:I2)**

Here are the results for:

OUSD: 

<img width="898" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-10 at 6 29 34 AM" src="https://github.com/ManuMphuthi/J124-FINAL-PROJECT/assets/140004593/a4d18db2-ccfa-4e41-ac1b-806d6fac320d">

Percentages of each demographic are shown below. I used this formula **=(A2*100)/B4** and chnaged the values as need to calculate the percentages of each demographic. 

<img width="910" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-10 at 6 39 09 AM" src="https://github.com/ManuMphuthi/J124-FINAL-PROJECT/assets/140004593/632e1f18-2787-4544-bb82-4be1504ae3a7">


And F-CUSD: 

<img width="913" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-10 at 6 30 02 AM" src="https://github.com/ManuMphuthi/J124-FINAL-PROJECT/assets/140004593/195e8b3c-f4a1-41e5-8315-af3045968ced">

Percentages of each demographic are shown below. I used this formula **=(A2*100)/B4** and chnaged the values as need to calculate the percentages of each demographic. 


<img width="917" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-10 at 6 37 19 AM" src="https://github.com/ManuMphuthi/J124-FINAL-PROJECT/assets/140004593/87dacbc3-0638-4587-94c3-d19549aa14dc">

In sum, there are 11,813 Black students in OUSD, which represent 23.53% of the total student population. There are 1,068 Black students in F-CUSD,, which represent 5.18% of the total student population.  

#### 5. What are the suspension rates of Black students in OUSD and F-CUSD? How do they differ from other demographics? 

Still in the doc called "OUSD and FCUSD Student Data", I insert the suspension data from OUSD into a new sheet. This data is taken from [this dataset]( from the California Department of Education: 








#### 6. What are the expulsion rates of Black students in OUSD and F-CUSD? How do they differ from other demographics?
