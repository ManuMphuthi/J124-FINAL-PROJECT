# J124-FINAL-PROJECT: Data Analysis and Visualization of the Effects of the Distribution of Black Teachers on Black Students 
## by Emmanuelle Mphuthi 
### Story Summary 

My story aims to highligth the effects of having a small Black teacher population on Black students in the state of California. Particularly, this projet found that in schools with a small Black teacher population, Black students encounter a higher risk of getting punished, suspended and/or expelled from school, as opposed to schools with a larger Black teacher population. I focused on two Californian school districts in Alameda County and Orange County: Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) and Folsom-Cordova Unified (F-CUSD). The data analysis found that there is a strong correlation between the improvement of the overall academic performance of Black students all levels of education, and a strong presence of Black teaching personnel at their school. It is hard to define what a "strong" presence means, but I believe the minimum ratio of Black students per Black teacher should be at least 10:1. This would prevent more Black students from falling into the school-to-prison pipeline, which disproportionately targets students of color, and particular Black male students. Additionally, this story aims to contest the assumption that a school with a low Black student populaton does not require an equal or greater Black teacher population. I am to demonstrate that these students, who are already minorities within their peer group, need even more representation in the people in charge of their education. Thus, this story aims to propose that more Black teachers be a) formed in the areas where they are scarce so they may assist Black students and imporve their future prospects and b)transferred to these areas in order to fill the vacancy. Having teachers that are the same race as students significantly improves morale, retention, graduation/achievement rates and attendance. 

I chose Alameda County and the Oakland Unified School District for a few reasons. Firstly, Black teachers make up the fourth largest demographic in the county's total teacher population (1,047 out of 12,320 teachers betweeen 2018-2019). Despite representing only 8.50% of the total teacher population in the state, it is vital to note that Alameda County is the county with the most Black teachers in California, as per my analysis.  Secondly, the OUSD is the district with the msot significant Black teacher population from 2018-2019. Black students in the OUSD represent 23.50% of the total student population between 2018-2019, the second largest demographic after Hispanic or Latino children. 
I chose Sacramento County because it had more or less the same teacher and teacher population as Alameda County (both over 12,000 teachers and over 200,000 students from 2018-2019). I chose the Folsom-Cordova Unfiied School District for the simple reason that it had the lowest amount of Black teachers in the entire county (_____ teachers out of ____________). The Black student population is also quite small (_____students out of ___________).

All data was sourced from the California Department of Education (CDE). 

#### Potential Interview Contacts:
1. Tony Thurmond, the Superintendent of Public Instruction
   - E-mail: Tony@TonyThurmond.com
   - Contact Number: 916-319-0800 (Executive Office) 
   - Reason: As he Superintendent of Public Instruction in California, Tony Thurmond is responsible for enforcing educational law, reforming or improving education programs at all levels, reforming or improving child care programs,and deciding the measures of education regulation across the state. He would be a useful source, as he might have information that is not disclosed on the CA Department of Education website. Since his inauguration in 2019, Thurmond has put in place the Black Student Achievement Taskforce to "call out the effects that systemic and institutional racism have had on Black students in California" and "to increase funding to lowest performing students, ban suspensions and expulsions in preschools, and secure funding for suspensions and chronic absenteeism programming", according to the CDE. It would be extremely valuable to gain access to the findings of this taskforce. 
  
2. Nancy William McGee, Director of the Student Achievement and Support Division
   - E-mail: N/A
   - Contact Number: 916-319-0926
   - Reason: As the Director of this division, McGee works with local educational agencies, administrators, teachers, students, families and educational stakeholders to "ensure state and federal policies and legislation are aligned, supported, and implemented in a manner that provides each of California’s students with meaningful access to a fair, equitable, high-quality, and well-rounded education", according to the CDE. McGee would be a useful source as he specializes on student achievement, meaning he has expertise on the regulation and programs that have been implemented to address racial discrepancies on test scores. I could not find this information on the CDE's official website, so hearing from him would be helpful. He also works directly with families according to his division's bio, meaning he might have a unique take on the issues discussed in this project. 

#### Additional Resources:
1. ["The National Center for Education Statistics"](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2020/2020103/index.asp#:~:text=In%20the%202017–18%20school,were%20Black%20and%20non%2DHispanic.)
   - The dataset on the linked website provides a unique perspective on the issues discussed in this project. For instance, the first finding is that "teachers of a given race/ethnicity were more often found in schools where their race/ethnicity matched a majority of the student body". This is useful because it sort answers one of the questions I ask in my Data Analysis and touches ont he overarching theme of this project. More importantly, it argues that "in schools where the majority of students are not White, the majority of teachers tended to be White". This is literally the essence of this project.
  
2. ["The Black Teacher Initiative"](https://blackteachercollaborative.org/stats/#:~:text=Georgia%20is%20in%20the%20top,in%20the%20country%2C%20behind%20Texas.)
   - This dataset would be a very vital additional resource, as it is led by Black teachers and was specifically made to highlight to discrepancies of the racial makeup of both student and teacher populations across the United States. The BTI also has interactive data visualization in the form of graphs and maps that the user can filter as needed. If I were to use this resource, I would filter out all US regions besides "West" and specifically look at the "Where are the Black students in the US?" map, the "Where are the Black teachers?" map and more importantly, the "Teacher Student" scatterplot, which answers some of the main questions of this project such as what is the Black-teacher-to-Black-Student-ratio in California. The scatterplot shows that for every Black teacher in California, there are 28.3 students. Finally, this data fills in the gaps in the data fromt he CDE in terms of reading proficiency by race for example, though that data is limited as well. 


### Data Analysis Process 

This section of the project outlines the questions I asked myself while going through the data in the Sourcing section. 

The data did not require much cleaning in Google Sheets, as data could be easily filtered at will on the CDE database. 

#### 1. What is the total number of black teachers in California from 2018-19? Then, compare to other demographics (ie White, Hispanic etc.)

First, I searched for teacher numbers by race in the CDE databse and found the following dataset: "Certified Staff by Race/Ethnicity Alameda County 2018-19". I filtered out all types of school administration/staff from the "Certified Staff" except for "Teachers". Then I filtered the year to 2018-2019, which was the most recently available timeframe. Then, I downloaded the data county by county and compiled this ["spreadsheet"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wVNvsiat7hItWwOruKtMefD4igkixYkXFAHGS9HAKqM/edit?usp=sharing)

At this stage, I onyl had one sheet with the total number of teachers in California by county from 2018-2019.
